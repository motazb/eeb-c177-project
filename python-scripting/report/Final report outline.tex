\section{Introduction}
This program uses data from a collection of product-related injury reports in the US from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), which is a national probability sample of hospitals in the U.S. and its territories. The data includes patient information from each NEISS hospital for every emergency visit involving an injury associated with consumer products. The types of products involved in injuries include: floors, stairs, beds, basketball, bicycles, football, chairs, knives, bathtubs/showers, ceiling/walls.

This program is important because it gives a perspective on the frequencies of injuries caused by different products and the demographics of patients who were injured by them. By determining the demographics of those injured by these products, further studies can be conducted to find out why they are more likely to be injured by them, and how to prevent that from continuing to happen.

Talk about the purpose of the program and what it does. Talk about who can use it and its importance.\\\\\\


\section{Methods}
Talk about the code used and how I made it. Talk about how its run by Python through the terminal.\\
